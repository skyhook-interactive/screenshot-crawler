# Example usage

### Crawl urls on a site and take screenshots
`casperjs screenshot-crawler.js --url=http://www.example.com --release=v1 --screenshots-folder=./dest/`


### Pass specific URLs
`casperjs screenshot-crawler.js --release=v1 --screenshots-folder=./test/`

For this to work, the screenshots folder must exist with urls.txt file located in it. See the /dest/ folder.
